/**
 * 
 * @OOP
 * 
 * Object oriented programming language...
 * 
 * @Abstraction
 * Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an
 * overview perspective of the thing we're implementing, instead of messing
 * with details that don't really matter to our implementation.
 * 
 * @Encapsulation
 * Keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not
 * accessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public
 * interface (API)
 * 
 * @Inheritance
 * Making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child
 * class, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes. This allows us to
 * reuse common logic and to model real-world relationships.
 * 
 * @Polymorphism
 * A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class. It's
 * more than that___
 * 
 * @Prototypal_Inheritance There are 3 ways to craete it in javascript, 
 * 
 *  - Constructor function
 *  - Class (sytactical sugar only)
 *  - Object.create()
