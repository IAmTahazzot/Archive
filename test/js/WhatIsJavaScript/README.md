# WhatIsJavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, prototype-based object-oriented multi-paradigm 
interpreted or just-in-time compiled dynamic single-threaded 
garbage-collected programming language with first-class function and a 
non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

## Keywords

- High-level: N/A
- Garbage-collected: Cleans un-necessary objects from memory automatically ðŸ˜Š
- Interpreted or just-in-time compiled: automatically compiled on JS-Engine
- Multi-paradigm: An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will 
  direct your coding style and techniques such as:

  1. Procedural programming
  2. Object-oriented programming (OOP)
  3. Functional programming (FP)

- Prototype-based object-oriented: Inheritance from another object.
- First-class functions: In a language with first-class functions, functions 
  are simply treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions as 
  an arguments and return them from function. (great feature ðŸ˜Š)
- Dynamic: Data types assigned automatically & changed implicitly
- Single-threaded: It can only do one thing at a time.
- Non-blocking event loop: Doesn't block any code (ability to works at 
  background)
- Concurrency model: How the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks 
  happening at the same time.
