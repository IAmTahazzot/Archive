# What is OOP?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. We use objects to model real-world or abstract features. Objects may contain data (Properties) and code (Methods). By using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block.

Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another. Interactions happen through a public interface (API): Methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to communitcate with the object.

OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code, to make it more flexiable and easier to maintain (avoid "Spaghetti code")
